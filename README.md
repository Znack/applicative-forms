# Applicative Forms powered by TypeScript

Proof of concept, extremely early stage. Learn the idea and share your thoughts about interface.

## Design
API can be found in `src/forms.ts` file with basic implementation. Implementation is raw, it is done just for running demo. The main area of research is still investigating what API can be exposed.

## Demo
Run `npm run dev` to start demo locally, open `http://localhost:1234` in browser.
